# Sorting-Algo-Visualizer
In this project, I built an application for visualizing various sorting algorithms using Canvas API in JavaScript. It visualizes various sorting algorithms including Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort. It uses random function to generate data list for sorting and algorithms will sort the data in ascending order.
